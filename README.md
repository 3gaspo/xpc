**Code is currently undergoing rework in order to better accomodate for deep learning models.**

The package enables to decompose the forecasts of a model according to specified parts, e.g a climate and non-climate part.

The method is based on Shapley values in addition to a novel pipeline to aggregate, heighten and normalize. We obtain an interpretable decomposition of the time series.

More details will be provided in an upcoming paper. Example notebooks are available to experiment on the package.
